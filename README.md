# 🏛️ Event Hall Resource Scheduling

This project automates the allocation of multiple events to limited halls while avoiding time conflicts and maximizing hall utilization.  
It demonstrates two classic scheduling algorithms — **Greedy (Interval Scheduling)** and **Backtracking** — to compare efficiency and optimization quality.

---

## 🔍 Features

- 📅 **Assigns events to halls without overlapping times**
- ⚡ **Implements both Greedy and Backtracking approaches**
- 📊 **Calculates and compares scheduling performance**
- 🧩 **Computes hall utilization percentages**
- 🧠 **Useful for understanding resource allocation and optimization algorithms**

## 💡 Use Cases

- 🎤 Event and conference scheduling  
- 🏫 Classroom or resource booking systems  
- 🔬 Research or learning in algorithm design and performance analysis  

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript  
- **Algorithms:**  
  - Interval Scheduling (Greedy)  
  - Backtracking

## 🚀 Output

Generates an optimized hall allocation schedule including:
- ✅ Scheduled events  
- ❌ Unscheduled events  
- ⏱ Computation time  
- 📈 Hall utilization metrics

## 📌 Algorithms Used

### 1️⃣ Greedy (Interval Scheduling)
Selects events based on earliest finishing time to maximize non-overlapping allocations efficiently.

### 2️⃣ Backtracking
Explores all possible event-hall combinations to find the optimal allocation with maximum utilization.
