# event-resource-scheduling

### 🏛️ Event Hall Resource Scheduling

This project automates the **allocation of multiple events to limited halls** while avoiding time conflicts and maximizing hall utilization. It demonstrates two classic scheduling algorithms: **Greedy (Interval Scheduling)** and **Backtracking**, to compare efficiency and optimization quality.

### 🔍 Features

* 📅 Assigns events to halls without overlapping times
* ⚡ Implements both *Greedy* and *Backtracking* approaches
* 📊 Calculates and compares scheduling performance
* 🧩 Computes hall utilization percentages
* 🧠 Useful for understanding resource allocation and optimization algorithms

### 💡 Use Cases

* Event and conference scheduling
* Classroom or resource booking systems
* Research or learning in algorithm design and performance analysis

### 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Algorithms:** Interval Scheduling (Greedy), Backtracking

### 🚀 Output

Generates an optimized **hall allocation schedule** with details of scheduled and unscheduled events, computation time, and hall utilization metrics.
